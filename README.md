# Personal Notes

## Hello.

### My name is Kingsley Okafor. This is a way for me to talk about some decisions I made while I worked on this. Please dismiss this if you think its unnecessary.

### First of all, except to implement the chart, I decided to build the entire application without any extra dependencies in order to make the app as lean as possible and also to stand out.

### Secondly, although making the website responsive wasn't part of the assessment, I paid attention to that for some screen sizes. (It is NOT mobile responsive). However, to see the implementation of the actual design, please view with a desktop or a device with a screen size **above 1024px.**

### Thirdly, I added loading states for when data from the API is being fetched dynamically.

### Finally, I want to commend the UI/UX designer who worked on this. The design is really clean. Thumbs up!!!

Please go through my code and if possible I would love to hear your thoughts about how well I did on this project. It took me about 6 hours to complete. You can email me on [nonsokingsley61@gmail.com](mailto:nonsokingsley61@gmail.com) . Thank you.
